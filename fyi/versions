      Prefer element reference over method invocation (#156)
      
      * Prefer element reference over method invocation
      
      Ruby presents two ~syntactic~ sugarings that can not be distinguished
      unambiguously from syntax alone:
      
      First, array elements can be referenced using a bracketed argument after
      any amount of white space, so:
      
          x.[](0)
      
          x[0]
      
          x [0]
      
      are all equivalent.
      
      Second, methods may be invoked with omitted parends, so:
      
          f(y)
      
          f y
      
      are equivalent.
      
      The ambiguity can be seen when the function argument is a literal array:
      
          f [0]
      
      At this point, there is no syntactic information that can distinguish
      between element reference and procedural invocation.
      
      This can be seen by running this program in irb:
      
          irb(main):001:0> x = [0, 1, 2]
          => [0, 1, 2]
          irb(main):002:0> x.[](0)
          => 0
          irb(main):003:0> x [0]
          => 0
          irb(main):004:0> def y(z)
          irb(main):005:1>   z
          irb(main):006:1> end
          => :y
          irb(main):007:0> y([0])
          => [0]
          irb(main):008:0> y [0]
          => [0]
      
      Previously, tree-sitter-ruby handled this ambiguity by presenting both
      `x [0]` and `y [0]` as procedural invocation.
      
      However, this causes a parse error as described in
      tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ruby#146, when parsing
      
          d.find { |x| a(x) } [b] == c
      
      Here I add an optional, lower-precedence interpretation of `x [0]` as an
      element reference.
      
      Due to the construction of the grammar in this project, this
      unfortunately causes problems when attempting to parse constructs like:
      
          fun [0] do
            something
          end
      
      as the parser will eagerly consume `fun [0]` as the left-hand-side of
      a binary expression. To deal with this case, I explicitly add this
      construct to the `call` production rule. Unfortunately I had to resort
      to the GLR parser in order to resolve the ambiguity between these two
      rules.
      
      Finally, note that the tree obtained from the construct
      
          z [0] == 0
      
      is context-sensitive in Ruby. If `z` is an array type, it is interpreted
      as `binary ( reference ( identifier, integer ), integer`. If `z` is
      a method, it is interpreted as `call ( identifier, binary ( array
      (integer), integer)`. Since tree-sitter assumes the parsed language is
      context-free, there's no good way for us to resolve this ambiguity. This
      commit prefers the second, method-invocation, interpretation, which
      appears to be more common within the test corpus.
      
      * Use external scanner logic to distinguish between arrays & subscripts
      
      When an opening square bracket appears immediately after a callable
      expression like "a" or "a.b", we must decide between two possible
      interpretations of the bracket:
      1. It could be part of an element reference, as in
         `a[0] = true`.
      2. Or it could be an array literal, passed as an argumet, as in
         `puts [1, 2, 3]`
      
      If there is no preceding whitespace, the bracket should *always* be
      treated as part of an element reference. This matches MRI's behavior.
      
      If there *is* preceding whitespace, MRI makes its decision in a
      context-sensitive way, based on whether the preceding expression
      is a local variable or a method name.
      
      This parser is not context-sensitive, so we instead will interpret
      the bracket as part of an array literal whenever that is syntactically
      valid, and interpret it as part of element reference otherwise. The
      external scanner can use the validity of other expression tokens like
      `string` to infer whether an array literal would be valid.
